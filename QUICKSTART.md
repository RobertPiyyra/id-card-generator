# Cloudinary Migration - Quick Start Guide

## What Changed?

Your Flask app **no longer saves images locally**. Instead:
- 📸 **Photos** → Uploaded to Cloudinary (URL stored in `student.photo_url`)
- 🎴 **ID Cards** → Uploaded to Cloudinary (URL stored in `student.image_url`)
- 📄 **PDFs** → Uploaded to Cloudinary (URL stored in `student.pdf_url`)

This solves the Railway ephemeral storage problem — images now persist forever in the cloud.

---

## Key Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `models.py` | Added `photo_url`, `image_url`, `pdf_url` fields |
| `app.py` | Replaced all `.save()` calls with `upload_image()` |
| `corel_routes.py` | Updated PDF generation to fetch photos from Cloudinary |
| `utils.py` | Updated hash generation to accept URLs |

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ Photo Upload
```python
# OLD: Save locally
photo.save(os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, filename))

# NEW: Upload to Cloudinary
upload_image(photo_bytes, folder='photos')  # Returns URL
```

### 2️⃣ Card Generation
```python
# OLD: Save to static/generated/
template_img.save(jpg_path, "JPEG")
template_img.save(pdf_path, "PDF")

# NEW: Upload to Cloudinary
upload_image(jpg_bytes, folder='generated')  # Returns URL
upload_image(pdf_bytes, folder='generated', resource_type='raw')  # Returns URL
```

### 3️⃣ Database Storage
```python
# OLD
student.photo_filename = "timestamp_photo.jpg"
student.generated_filename = "gen_123.jpg"

# NEW
student.photo_url = "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/image/upload/xxx.jpg"
student.image_url = "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/image/upload/xxx.jpg"
student.pdf_url = "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/raw/upload/xxx.pdf"
```

## Environment Setup

Your `.env` file should already have these (they're required):
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

If not, add them from your Cloudinary dashboard.

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: Upload a Photo
1. Go to the form page (`/`)
2. Upload a new photo
3. Generate a card
4. **Expected**: Photo appears in preview, no files in `static/generated/`
5. **Check database**: `student.photo_url` should be a Cloudinary URL

### ✅ Test 2: Generate Card
1. Complete card generation
2. **Expected**: JPG and PDF should display/download
3. **Check database**: 
   - `student.image_url` = Cloudinary JPG URL
   - `student.pdf_url` = Cloudinary PDF URL

### ✅ Test 3: Preview
1. Click "View Preview" in admin
2. **Expected**: Preview loads from Cloudinary
3. **Check database**: `student.image_url` should be set

### ✅ Test 4: Download PDF
1. Click "Download PDF"
2. **Expected**: Redirects to Cloudinary or downloads
3. **Check database**: `student.pdf_url` should be set

### ✅ Test 5: Old Records (Legacy)
1. Check an old student record from before migration
2. **Expected**: Still shows photo (falls back to `photo_filename` if present)
3. **Edit and regenerate**: Should upload new versions to Cloudinary

## No Migration Script Needed

✨ **Automatic Fallback:**
- Old records with `photo_filename` still work
- Old records with `generated_filename` still work
- New records use URL fields
- Zero downtime, no data loss

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to upload photo"
**Cause**: Cloudinary credentials invalid or missing  
**Fix**: Check `.env` file has correct values from Cloudinary dashboard

### Issue: Photo not appearing in preview
**Cause**: Network timeout fetching from Cloudinary  
**Fix**: Check internet connection, Cloudinary API status

### Issue: Old previews missing
**Cause**: `static/generated/` files deleted  
**Fix**: They were never needed with Cloudinary; old records fall back to `photo_filename`

### Issue: PDF download fails
**Cause**: `pdf_url` not set or network issue  
**Fix**: Regenerate the card, check Cloudinary URL is accessible

## Performance Benefits

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Storage** | Limited by Railway disk | Unlimited (cloud) |
| **Persistence** | Lost on restart | Permanent |
| **Delivery Speed** | Server direct | Global CDN faster |
| **Availability** | Server dependent | 99.9% uptime |
| **Scalability** | Limited by server | Auto-scaling |

---

## No Code Changes Needed

✅ All routes work as before  
✅ All form submissions unchanged  
✅ All database queries unchanged  
✅ All emails unchanged  
✅ All templates compatible  

Just deploy and use!

---

## What About Old Files?

Old files in `static/generated/` and `static/uploads/` are:
- ✅ Still accessible (legacy fallback)
- ✅ Safe to delete (optional cleanup)
- ✅ Not used for new records

You can keep them for backward compat or delete them to free disk space.
